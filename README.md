local_FDA_orangebook
====================
Unfortunately, the FDA website is not yet particularly data friendly.

One script finds the latest version of Orangebook on the FDA website and converts it to a CSV.
DMF script finds the latest version of the drug master file and converts it to a CSV.

Once in CSV format, the data can be inserted into a SQL table, manipulated in Pandas or Excel, etc.
